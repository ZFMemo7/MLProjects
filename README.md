# Machine Learning Projects

**Objective**: To refine my repertoire in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing

**Current Interests**:
1. LLM local deployment for personal fine-tuning using QLORA / look into software and hardware tradeoffs
2. Exploring cutting-edge techniques / ideas (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
3. Effective feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning interpretability
